    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The make of the Indian sweet dish (dessert) Kheer usually consists of cereals, lentils or their flours.
        Sometimes
        even fruits and veggies.
        It resembles a pudding, and traditionally made with milk, sugar and some dry fruits. The choice flavorings
        include certain spices like saffron, cardamom, nutmeg, etc. and others like rose water, kewra water, etc. You
        may use vanilla or other fancy ingredients to flavor some of the modern-day preparations.
        Indian cuisine has many variations of a Kheer Recipe. So, you must be wondering what exactly is a Rice Kheer? It
        is basically the Indian variant of the rice pudding. The main ingredients in it are basmati rice, whole milk,
        sugar, ground spices and nuts.
        Sometimes, regional versions like the Bengali Payesh use nolen gur (date palm jaggery) in place of sugar as a
        sweetener. This results in a kheer which is usually light brown or beige in color.
        Along with Seviyan Kheer (vermicelli pudding) and Phirni (thick rice pudding), the Rice Kheer is also one of the
        most popular Kheer variations of North Indian cuisine in particular.

        This Kheer Recipe is a special from my mother-in-law’s recipe book. Till today, she makes the lovely Rice Kheer
        for any religious or festive occasion. I’m glad I got a chance to learn the know-hows of making it from her.
        Just like other Kheer varieties, Rice Kheer is also quite easy to make, by just slow-cooking the ingredients
        together in one pan or pot. The reason, I sometimes refer to this Kheer Recipe as the one-pot rice pudding.
        You just have to keep an eye on it, while it is simmering and keep stirring at intervals. It really does not
        demand much cooking skills.
        Kheer, known as payasam, is also crucial in South Indian cuisine. It is possible to make Rice Payasam or Paal
        Payasam as it is locally known, with either milk or coconut milk. The sweeteners can be sugar or jaggery.
        Usually at home, we make this Rice Kheer in slightly larger quantity. But I have scaled down the recipe which
        will yield about 4 to 5 small servings of this decadent Kheer.
        This super tasty Kheer recipe is a perfect fit for festive occasions like Diwali, etc. You can also serve it as
        a dessert after your lunch or dinner meals.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>The Indian version of a sweet pudding is what we refer to as Kheer. It is basically a milk-based dessert, which
        has other
        ingredients, sweetener and flavorings added to it. The most classic version of this dessert is the rich Rice
        Kheer, where you slo
        w-cook rice grains, whole milk and sugar to perfection. Addition of saffron, nuts, cardamom, etc. is quite
        subjective when it comes to this typical
        Kheer Recipe. This particular creamy version is my family’s heirloom recipe which you will love for its
        deliciousness.</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse ¼ cup basmati rice a couple of times in fresh water and then soak in enough water for 15 to 20
            minutes.</li>
        <li>While the rice grains are soaking, take 1-litre full-fat milk in a heavy wide pan or saucepan or kadai.</li>
        <li>Keep the pan on low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals so that the milk does not burn at the bottom of
            the pan.</li>
        <li>Let the milk come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Take 1 tablespoon milk from the pan in a small bowl. Let the milk become warm. Then, add a few saffron
            strands to the milk. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>After the milk begins to boil, drain all the water from the rice and add it to the boiling milk.</li>
        <li>Mix very well with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Simmer and cook the rice on low heat. No need to cover the pan when the rice is cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice grains till they are 50% done or half-done.</li>
        <li>Then, add 5 to 6 tablespoons sugar or as required. You can add raw sugar or white sugar. I generally use
            unrefined raw sugar.</li>
        <li>Mix the sugar in the milk.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook rice on low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals.</li>
        <li>Simmer till the rice grains are almost cooked.</li>
        <li>Then add ½ teaspoon green cardamom powder.</li>
        <li> Add 1 tablespoon each of sliced almonds, chopped cashews and sliced pistachios. You can blanch the almonds,
            if you prefer or just slice them raw.
            You can include various other nuts according to your preferences.</li>
        <li>Mix well.</li>
        <li>Then, add the prepared saffron milk.</li>
        <li>Again mix and continue to cook on low heat till the Rice Kheer thickens and the rice grains have completely
            cooked.</li>
        <li>Switch off the heat when the rice grains soften completely. The Kheer will also thicken. Scrape milk solids
            from the sides of the pan and add to the Kheer.
            Make a note that on cooling, Rice Kheer thickens more.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add 1 tablespoon golden raisins. At this step, you can add 1 tablespoon rose water or kewra water
            (pandanus water).</li>
        <li>Pour the Rice Kheer in individual serving bowls, and serve hot, warm or chilled. Refrigerate leftover Rice
            Kheer and consume within 1 to 2 days. You can eat it
            cold, or reheat it until warm.<br>
            If the Kheer has become very thick, add a splash of milk and reheat.</li>
    </ol>
